When I don't get to program enough at work, eventually I start programming
for fun at home. As the name suggests, most of my for-fun programming is
attemtping to solve problems from https://projecteuler.net.

A lot of this code dates back to around the end of my last job in late 2011,
especially the Scala stuff and some of the non-Project-Euler C++. I picked
this up again in December 2020, though, just doing stuff in Java because it's
easy and familiar.

Obviously, you can look at these if you're working on Project Euler.  But
seriously, what would be the point of doing the project if not to figure the
solutions out for yourself?
