Project Euler looks fun, so here are my (attempted) solutions for it.

Obviously, you can look at these if you're working on Project Euler.  But
seriously, what would be the point of doing the project if not to figure the
solutions out for yourself?

*Edit:* This has become my miscellaneous bit bucket for personal programming
homework problems.  So, you'll find that I've gone and implemented a couple
types of trees in Scala and also started on C++ versions as well.  Eventually,
I should organize this stuff into different projects, but for now, it can all
live here.
