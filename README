Project Euler looks fun, so here are my (attempted) solutions for it.

Obviously, you can look at these if you're working on Project Euler.  But
seriously, what would be the point of doing the project if not to figure the
solutions out for yourself?

*Edit:* So, I've started throwing other "oh, I should implement one of those
in Scala" projects into here, like various algorithms and data structures.
Eventually, I should pull those out into their own project, but for now, they
can live here.
